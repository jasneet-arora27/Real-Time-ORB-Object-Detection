## Introduction ðŸŒŸ
Real-time image classification has various applications, including object detection, security systems, and augmented reality. This project focuses on using the ORB algorithm for efficient keypoint detection and descriptor extraction, combined with OpenCV for real-time video processing.

## Objectives ðŸŽ¯
- Implement the ORB algorithm for keypoint detection and descriptor extraction.
- Develop a real-time video processing pipeline for image classification.
- Classify objects in a video stream based on pre-loaded images.

## Technical Details ðŸ”§
- **Python:** A high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
- **OpenCV:** An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library designed for image and video processing tasks.
